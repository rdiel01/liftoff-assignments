### Overview
I am going to create an web application that will be used to manage a small restaurant inventory. Users will need to enter all items to begin with. When entering the inventory items they will also set the starting quantity, a minimum quantity and maximum quantity.Once the starting inventory is ready users will be able to up date the inventory at the end of each day by adjusting the tracked quantities. The application will know when a quantity goes below the minimum amount. Once this happens the item will be flagged for when an order needs to be placed. When the user is ready to create an order they will be able to view all items that are below the minimum amount that they set. The order will automatically determine how much of a given item will need to be order based on the maximum limit that the user also set. The user will be able to make changes to the order as they see fit and once they are happy with the selection they will be able to save the order and send the order information in an email. When the order is received the user will confirm that the shipment is correct. IF the quantities are all correct the user will be able to commit the order to the inventory, which will add the order amounts to the current inventory. If any quantities in the shipment are incorrect the user will be able to adjust the quantities before commit the order to the inventory. Order information will be saved as a backlog and will allow the user the see what has been ordered in the past.

The main user would be my sister that owns a restaurant. She current has to go into the store to do inventory and place orders on her days off. My plan is to create a way for any of her managers to be able to update the inventory and then she would be able to place the orders from her home on her days off. The added benefit of offer some backlog information will provide insight in to what has been order in the past and help with deciding what she may need to order.
